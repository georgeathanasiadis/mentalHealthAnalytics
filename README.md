Mental health analytics using Fitibit API, MongoDB and Streamlit

This project is an assignment for the MSc course "Web Data Mining" at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
In this work, we collect our personal data from Fitbit API and store them in a local MongoDB NoSQL database. Moreover, we provide interactive visualizations through the Streamlit python library to reveal data correlations and insights. Finally, we develop a state-of-the-art classifier to predict the stress level.
